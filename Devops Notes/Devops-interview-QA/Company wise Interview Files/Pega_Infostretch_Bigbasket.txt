 Company:: Pega Software Systems
1) Tell me about your current organization and day-2-day activities
2) Write terraform script for ASG (Auto Scaling Group) AWS with minimum 3 ec2 instances 

Provider.tf
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-east-1"
}
-------------------
resource "aws_instance" "my_first_ec2-1" {
     ami = "ami-04505e74c0741db8d"
        instance_type = "t2.micro"
        count = 3

        tags = {
           Name = "my-first-terra-ec2"
}

}


3) Write shell script to push a script/code to 5 target servers 


shell script
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#!/bin/bash

USERNAME=someUser
HOSTS="host1 host2 host3"
SCRIPT="pwd; ls"
for HOSTNAME in ${HOSTS} ; do
    ssh -l ${USERNAME} ${HOSTNAME} "${SCRIPT}"
done
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

ansible playbook
- name: Ansible Copy Example Local to Remote
  hosts: remoteserver
  tasks:
    - name: copying file with playbook
      become: true 
      copy:
        src: ~/Downloads/index.html
        dest: /var/www/html
        owner: apache
        group: apache        
        mode: 0644

4) What is ASG 
An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping
 for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. 
An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto
 Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies
 
 
5) Difference between Horizontal and Vertical autoscaling
6) In vertical autoscaling can you increase resources without downtime ?
No
7) How do you increase resource in ec2 instance 
horiontal auto scaling
				8) How do you automate the log collection of docker container 

Docker automatically aggregates container standard output and error streams (stdout/stderr) 
into log feeds which are retained by the Docker daemon. 
You can easily monitor logs to understand what’s going on in your containers.

9) How do you automate the log collection on k8s pods 

daemon set/sidecar container

10) what is the command for k8s logs ?
kubectl logs pod podname

11) What are the states of docker container

created
running
puase
exited
dead
restart


12) I have 2 images, one image is used to deploys one container, 2nd image is used to deploy 2nd container, 2nd container is failing, 
what is the state of the 2nd container 
Exited or terminated state

13) How will you check the states of the containers 
docker ps -a

14) How will you identify pods based on the namespace 
kubectl pod -n namespace

15) Do you know Python 
We use shell or Groovy or Yaml 

16) How enthusiastic are you to learn scripting and python ? 
Repeat
17) You said you have worked on end-2-end automated deployment - can you explain one scenario where you deployed the application end-2-end 
CI/CD Explain
18) How will you deploy containers using Jenkins
Installing Docker/K8s Plugins

19) What is kubeconfig , what does it contain ? 
		Me:	I answeres the token, username, password to connect to the cluster 
		Inteviewer: Are you sure ? ??

kubeconfig is a YAML file that contains either a username and password combination or 
a secure token that when read programmatically removes the need 
for the Kubernetes client to ask for interactive authentication. 

kubeconfig is the secure and standard method to enable access to your Kubernetes clusters.

1.how to migrate on-premises to aws?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buzusNljpy4


2.how you know the given IP adress is private subnet IP / public subnet IP.
we use url's like below to see the ip is public/private
https://whatismyipaddress.com/private-ip


3.services you worked in AWS
4.Diff b/w Arecord and Cname

A record-Using route53 it converts the URL into IP Address.
Cname-Domain name assigning antoher name.
Ex.www.google.com,www.google.in all points to www.google.com
5.Diff b/w ALB & Network loadbalancer
6.CI/CD 
7.How you push image to ECR

docker push aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/centos:6.6 (replace the aws_account_id by your account id)
docker login along with aws credentials like un & pwd ,Aws accout id with region

ECR works with regionwise?
Yes

8.Route 53
DNS SERVER POINT TO ONE HOSTMACHINE TO OTHER 
Explian routing policy
	LATENCY ROUTING
	Weighted routing
A record-Using route53 it converts the URL into IP Address.
Cname-Domain name assigning antoher name.


9.Explain containerzation
10.did you experince in any orchestration tools.explain
11.20 linux commands 
12.what are providers and provisioners
13.how you integrate sonarqube in your pipeline
14.did you configured artifactory.explain
15.is it possible to change the instance type?how?
Running instance stop & got to actions & change instance type

16.what is ur experience on terraform
17.do you have written a lambda code
18.How you configure and authenticate ECR with your local machine
https://blog.dbi-services.com/how-to-push-an-image-into-amazon-ecr-with-docker/
19.Tell me your experince about EKS
Using fargate(serverless compute service for the containers that can be used to deploy EKS & ECS)

20.How you connect or access your private subnet to outside
NATGATEWAY

21.explain VPN and types

virtual private network
VPN: 
Is mainly used to establish a secure and private tunnel from you network or device to aws network 
 Aws site-to-site vpn: enables you to securely connect your on-premises network to your vpc. 
 AWS client vpn : enables you to securely connect users to AWS or on premises network. 
Do we have another way we can connect to the resources in a private subnet? 
We can setup a vpn server in the public subnet and configure it to connect to resources residing 
the private subnet

It create a private tunnel & establish secure connection between client/several

22.Why HELM chart

ssh -i ./sendy.pem ubuntu@52.5.229.252


			9. what is multi pod upload in k8?

			10. what is replication in RDS?
			
			its a backup of local to cloud (replication)
			ITS like a mirror image of local to cloud
			Amazon RDS replication entails replicating data from on-premises databases to the Amazon RDS cloud, 
			and for some use cases may also involve replicating data from an RDS instance to another type of cloud-based system
			
11. i have 5 pods running, i want to scale to 8 pods what is the command?
kubectl autoscale deployment.v1/apps --replicas=8
