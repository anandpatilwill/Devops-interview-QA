2. explain the encryption in s3, root volume ?
       Amazon S3 uses AES-256 bit encryption to encrypt the data 
	   with the customer provided key and removes the key  its memory post completion of the encryption process
	   
	ex: Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)

	    Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)
