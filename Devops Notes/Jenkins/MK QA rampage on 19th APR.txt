QA list from MK Half centuary rampage 
===================================================================================
1.k8 architecture?
2. how to check the particular container logs?  

ANS:kubectl logs pod_name -c container_id

3. how to clear the dangling images in docker?  --->docker prune image

4. what are dangling images?

  ANS:dangling images will be created at the build time, most of the time docker will automaticlally deletes, 
       if not we need use the " docker image prune"
  
5. what is the command to create docker image? 

   ANS:docker build -t image_name .
 
6. difference b/w entry point and CMD?
       ANS:1.both are used to define the execution time of a container 
	       2.if we use multiple CMD and ENTRYPOINT only last command will be considered
		   3.If we use both CMD and ENTRYPOINT in the same Dockerfile, ENTRYPOINT will get the 
              highest priority and the command of CMD will become as argumetns to ENTRYPOINT	
			  
7. how to over write the CMD?
   
   Docker run -it container name imagename CMD 	["bin/bash"]
   
8. what are the container status? 

     ANS:created
	     Running
		 paused
		 restarting
		 
9. docker container logs? 
    
	ANS:docker logs container_id

		   RUN
		   CMD
		   ENTRYPOINT
           COPY
           ADD ---->   
		   ARG--->Using ARG we can pass parameters to Dockerfile as user inputs...ARG <var_name>=<default_value>
 
		   
14. how to install package inside a container?  

    ans:RUN apt install package_name inside Docker fiele
        then run docker build -t IMAGE_NAME .  "where you are docker file present"
		
	
15. Multi-stage docker file? ---->not covered

16. what are namespace in k8s and why do we use it ?
   
    namespaces is a way of applying isolation  to support multiple clusters of K8 in the physical namespace
	we have 4 types
	 1.default
	 2.Kube-system
	 3.kube-public
	 4.kube-node-lease
	 
17. how you will you deploy an object in a namespace?

   kubectl create namespace test
   kubectl apply -f deploy.yml -n test

18. how to create name space?
      ANS:kubectl create namespace test

19. What type of probes have you used in your applciaton?
     ANS: explain liveness with yml file
	      better to know how livemess probe will work
		  
20. What are probes and explain types of probes?
      probes are used to check the application status 
	   for example liveness and Readiness Probe 
        take any one probe explain which method method you used
		
21. livenessProbe, what happens when I give "/health" in httpGet:

22.difference B/w liveness and Readiness probe?
    
23 what happens when Readiness  fails?
   
    ANS:the endpoints controller removes the Pod's IP address from the endpoints of all Services that match the Pod
	
24.How do you take backup of docker container?

  we create volume with docker create volume vol1
  the we attach the volume to a container
  
    or
  
  we create a image from the container 
    docker commit con_id image_name
	login to docker hub by providing credentials
	retag the image
	docker tag older_image ne_image
	docker push retaged_image:tag_name
	
	or
	login to docker hub by providing credentials
	run docker build -t docker_username/image_name:latest .
	docker push docker_username/image_name:latest
	
25.how to push and pull to docker hub?

     login to docker hub by providing credentials
	run docker build -t docker_username/image_name:latest .
	docker push docker_username/image_name:latest 
	
26.why do we need to use sidecar contianer?

     to moniter the application container using monitor tools like promethus,grafana, kubernetes dashboard,CAdvisor
	 
27.how to give sudo access to specific user?
     we create a user with 
	    sudo create user user_name
		sudo passwd user user_passwd
		add the user to sudoers file with all the permisions
		
28. what is taint and tolerence in k8?
        taint is used to taint a node and tolerence will be given in the pod spec fiele
		when the shedular assigns a pod to the node..if the taint and toleration matches the pods will be created or assigns to that node
		we use two types in the taint configuration effect
		
		1.Noschedule: if there is at least one un-ignored taint with effect NoSchedule then Kubernetes will not schedule the pod onto that node
		2.NoExecute:if there is at least one un-ignored taint with effect NoExecute then the pod will be evicted from the node (if it is already running on the node), 
		             and will not be scheduled onto the node (if it is not yet running on the node)

29. if i want to deploy a application to that node, how to do that?
       explain node selector
		
30. explain service types?
    ClusetIP
	NodePort
	Loadbalencer
	
31.when we use clusterIp and load balancer?
     CLusterIp for internal communication inside the cluster
	 Loadbalencer userd for external communication using external load balancer
	 
32.deployed one application trying to access that but not able to connect explain trouble shooting steps?
    should ask harsha sir

33.What is service endpoints?
  
    An endpoint is an resource that gets IP addresses of one or more pods dynamically assigned to it,
	along with a port. An endpoint can be viewed using kubectl get endpoints

34.what is headless service?
    headless services used to avoild load balancing for the applications which is running inside a container
	and we usually use this service for statefull application to stick to a pod or application

35.what is difference B/w statefullset and deployment?
     deployment is nothing but stateless application
	 explain statefull vs stateless
	 
36.when do we use daemonset?
    daemonset always carries a copy of pod to all the running and newly created nodes
	
	usage is to monitor the node metrics
	
37.how do you delete the docker container which are existed state?
     
	 docker rm $(docker ps -q --filer status=exited)
	 
38. How do you deploy a pod to master node? is it possible ? if not why?

     we can't assign a pod to a master node untill and unless we match the taint of master node 
	 to pod tolerance.
	 ex: kubectl describe node <master_node_name> | grep Taint
	 
39.command to create the docker volume?
    docker create volume volume_name
	
40.how to delete the unused docker images and container ? tell me the command?

    docker system prune
	
41.explain helm file structure?

    chart.yml:This is where you put all the information about the chart you are packaging ex:apiversion,name,discription,appversion,load dependencies
	charts:this where we store other charts ex: downloaded charts will be present
	templates:
	  manifestfiles:deployment.yml,service.yml,configmap.yml,secrets.yml etc...
	   _helper.tpl:which containes a functions we use those functions in the manifest files to create a templates
	     NOTE.txt: gives a release information
    Values.yaml: This is where you define all the values you want to inject into your templates
	.helmignore: This holds all the files to ignore when packaging the chart. Similar to .gitignore, if you are familiar with git
	
42.how to check deployment history in helm?
    
	helm history release_name 
	
43. what is the difference B/w CMD and RUN?

44.how do you manage dependencies  in helm?
    we load dependencies in chart.yml file
	
45. in k8, why do we need to have the master node as a odd number?
	
46.how to run command inside the pods?
     
	 kubectl describe pod pod_name "copy the container name"
	 kubectl exec -it container_name /bin/bash
	 
47.what is init container?

48.write a jenkins pipeline , it has 4 stages..1st stage on master 2nd & 3rd on slave1 parallelly 4th on any availability node?
     ============similar to this===================
	 
	 pipeline {
            agent { label 'master' }
			   stages {
			        stage('SCM') {
					  steps{ 
					      sh 'echo "this is SCM stage"'
						  
						  }   
				
					}
					agent {label ' slave 1'}
					
					paralle
					
					   {
 					     stages
						 {
						  }
						  stage( 'Build and test')
						  {
						   steps {
						   sh 'echo "this is Build stage" 
						 
						 }
					}
                        stage( 'Build and test')
						  {
						   steps {
						   sh 'echo "this is Build stage"
                					
				 }
				 
	   }					 
				
                agent any 
				  stages {
				        stage ("deploy stage")
						  steps {
						     sh ' echo "this deploy stage"'
							 
                     }
                       					 
				}
			}	
			
			
			}
   
49. How to pass the env variables to a job?
    You can use Environment Injector Plugin to set environment variables in Jenkins at job and node levels
	
50.how to restrict the node to run any job in jenkins?
