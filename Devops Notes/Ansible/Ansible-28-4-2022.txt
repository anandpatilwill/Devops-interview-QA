  What is ansible?
Ansible is simple, open-source, configuration management tool used for IT 
automation engine for cloud infrastructure, in-house servers.	

 to provision the underlying infrastructure of your environment, virtualized hosts and hypervisors,
  network devices, and bare metal servers.
  
Ansible push based configuration management system/tool
   1. ansible dones not require any dedicated agent running on the target host manchines.
   2. minimun ansible requirement is host machines with pyhton installed on it.
   3. we only require a proper ssh connection between the controller and the host machines.
   
   
Advantages:

	1. free/open source
	2. Very simple to steup up
	3. Agent less CM tool

Difference between Terraform and Ansible Provisioning
Letâ€™s see how Terraform vs. Ansible battle differentiates from each other:

                       Terraform                                                                                                   	Ansible
1) Terraform is a provisioning tool.	                                                            |    Ansible is a configuration management tool.
2) It is the best fit for orchestrating cloud services and setup cloud infrastructure from scratch. |	 It is mainly used for configuring servers with the right software and updates already configured resources.
3) Terraform does not support bare metal provisioning by default.	                            |    Ansible supports the provisioning of bare metal servers.
4) It does not provide better support in terms of packaging and templating.                         | 	 It provides full support for packaging and templating.

Ansible Inventory 
	 Static Inventory
		- It is file which contains the ip and configuration of connection to target host machines 
		  on which we want execute our playbooks
		- we can group the hosts in inventory.
		- default location of host file is /etc/ansible/hosts
		- each line except group name is considered as a single host connection configuration.
		[frontend]
		13.233.104.27 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_become_user=root
		15.206.185.128 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_become_user=root

		[backend]
		15.206.185.128 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_become_user=root
                - To pass custom inventory file "ansible -m ping -i <inventoryfile>"
		
	 Dynamic Inventory	
			- Is basically a script which will gives the inventory output.
			- we can use python, perl, bash 
                        - script provided by ansible https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/contrib/inventory/ec2.py  Using AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and command like "ansible-playbook -i ec2.py myplaybook.yml"

To install ansible (Ubuntu)

1. Establish a passwordless connection
ssh-keygen -t rsa (optional)

use ssh-copy-id username@remote_host (optional) or manually paste

sudo apt update

sudo apt install ansible


To setup inventory file

$ sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts


To check ansible inventory
ansible-inventory --list -y


To test connection to host

ansible all -m ping


		
Ansible playbook 
------------------------------------------------
	playbook
		- can contain n numner of play 
				- each play is designated to run n number task 
							- each task is designated to execute a module (only one module per task)
-------------------------------------------------

Some Example Playbooks

#Ansible playbook to install nginx on RHEL distribution


tasks:
 -name:create a directory nginx
  file:
    path: /ubuntu/home/nginx
    state: directory

 -name: Installing nginx
  yum:
    name:nginx
    state:latest

 -name: start nginx
  service
    name:nginx
    state:start



#Ansible playbook to install tomcat on ubuntu

tasks:
 -name: installing tomcat
  apt:
   name: tomcat
   state: latest
 -name: start tomcat
  systemctl:
    name:tomcat
    state: start

 -name: status of tomcat running or not
  systemctl:
    name:tomcat
    state:status


#Ansible playbook to install tomcat on server using groupname from inventory

 -name:play_1
  hosts: frontend
  tasks:
   -name: install tomcat
    apt:
     name: tomcat
     state: latest
   -name: start tomcat
    systemctl:
     name:tomcat
     state:start 


 - name: Play_1
   hosts: backend
   tasks:
     - name: Install git (backend)
       become: true
       apt:
         name: git
         state: present
         update_cache: yes
     - name: Install jq (backend)
       become: true
       apt:
         name: jq
         state: latest
         update_cache: yes		
		 
Installing multiple items with single task 

---
 - name: Demo
   hosts: frontend
   tasks:
     - name: Install git (frontend)
       become: true
       apt:
         name: "{{ item }}"
         state: present
         update_cache: yes
       with_items:
           - git
           - nginx
           - memcached
           - jq
           - curl
           - wget
